# Usage:
#   rv-init [ruby_selector] -- [cmd]

#
# Create a gemsh gem environment, by default at .rv/<ruby_selector>,
# and run the given command in it.
# Set $GEMENV to override the gem environment location.
# Chruby must already know about the ruby named by <ruby_selector>
# before running this for gem installation to work as the command.
# If you leave off ruby_selector, it'll pick whatever's in
# .ruby-version.
