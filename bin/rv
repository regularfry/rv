#   rv <ruby_selector> [command]
#
# Run a command (defaulting to $SHELL) with the ruby and gemenv chosen
# by the given ruby_selector, which is simply passed to chruby-exec.
# Set the $GEMENV environment variable if you want the gem environment
# to be put somewhere other than .env/<ruby_selector>.

# This slightly odd pair of lines says: everything after the ruby
# specification is the command to run inside the chruby-exec subshell,
# defaulting to the user's $SHELL.

# In a similar fashion, we can override the default gemenv selector
# here:
