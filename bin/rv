#   rv <ruby_selector> [command]
#
# Run a command (defaulting to $SHELL) with the ruby and gem environment chosen
# by the given ruby_selector, which is simply passed to chruby-exec.  Set the
# $GEMENV environment variable if you want the gem environment to be put
# somewhere other than .rv/<ruby_selector>.

# In a similar fashion, we can override the default gem environment selector
